When everything is engulfed in darkness, you can’t see clearly.
The future is lost.
The present is suffering.
The past is forgotten.
All happiness from the past is clouded by today's sadness.
But was it ever any different?
Haven’t I been miserable all my life?
Was there even a point in time when life was worth living?
I don’t know. I can’t remember anything.
Maybe your favourite memory could help me remember too.
Please, my friend.
Think of a moment in your life you come back to whenever you need strength. 
A pure, protective magical concentration of happiness and hope.
Tell me.
What is your happiest memory?

Answer

Player input - the happy memory

Thank you, my friend. You were utmost helpful.

The room is lighted up. The doors open, and the text next to the door vanishes. The player comes to the door and leaves the room

I couldn’t do all of that without your help.
Listening to what makes you happy, what makes your heartbeat.
What your reasons for getting up every morning are…
What makes your life worth living…
It was all very inspiring.
I think that now…
I finally know how to move forth.
I finally know what I should do.

Doors get shut with a screeching sound. The screen gets darker, and only a small beam of light is shining under the door
