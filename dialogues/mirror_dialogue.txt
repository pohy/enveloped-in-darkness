When everything is engulfed in darkness, you can’t see clearly.
The future is lost.
The present is suffering.
The past is forgotten.
All happiness from the past is clouded by today's sadness.
But was it ever any different?
Haven’t I been miserable all my life?
Was there even a point in time when life was worth living?
I don’t know. I can’t remember anything.
Maybe your favourite memory could help me remember too.
Please, my friend.
Think of a moment in your life you come back to whenever you need strength. 
A pure, protective magical concentration of happiness and hope.
Tell me.
What is your happiest memory?
