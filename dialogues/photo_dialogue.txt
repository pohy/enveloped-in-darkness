Look at this. My supposed friends.
Friends…
Yeah, at the time, they looked like friends.
But man… how quickly the tides turn.
Not so friendly after all.
Under all that polish they were mean and cruel.
Once they were through with me…
I had no one to whom I could go for comfort.
No one who would help me.
And then my heart turned cold…
Do you have someone you can lean on?
A person who is always there for you? 
Tell me…
Who in your life can you call a true friend?
[player_input name=friend][/player_input][continue] I don't want to share [/continue]
You don’t want to help me? But why? Is there a reason? [player_input name=friend][/player_input] [continue] That is personal question [/continue]
I guess you’re [b]just[/b] like everybody else. [player_input name=friend][/player_input][continue] I won't answer you [/continue]
But I can’t say I quite gather why you are this stubborn. [player_input name=friend][/player_input][continue] Don't be so pushy [/continue]
What do you stand to lose? Please… I simply need your help… [player_input name=friend][/player_input][continue] Please let me go [/continue]
I have nobody else… [player_input name=friend][/player_input][continue] ... [/continue]
A short answer… So I can finally understand… [player_input name=friend][/player_input]
Thank you. I am truly grateful to you. 
It must be nice to have supportive friends.
But even if one has no friends…
…there are still people that have your back…
…right?
I am talking about the people bound to you by blood.
Family, of course.
The ones who always have your best interests at heart. 
Well… at least in theory…
My family isn’t there for me…
But you don’t have that problem, do you?
Tell me, my friend.
Who in your family are you closest to?
[player_input name=family][/player_input]
That’s great. It must be wonderful to have someone you can rely on.
To not feel lost, or forgotten…
To feel that you matter to someone…
