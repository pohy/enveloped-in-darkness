[wave amp=50.0 freq=5.0 connected=1]Now I finally know how to destroy you.[/wave]

Look at you…
You want to escape this overwhelming darkness.
And you can.
But…
…not me.
The darkness is everywhere around me.
It consumes me.
You want to leave?
Just like everyone else, huh?
Well, no worries, my friend. 
I will let you go.
But I need your help first.
I will let you go if you help me get my darkness under control.
Look at you – you look pretty well off.
Content. Prospering. 
I want to be like you.
I want to understand what makes you happy.
I want to know how to be happy myself.
I just have a few questions. 
A few simple questions – that’s all there is to it.
I will let you go if you answer them.
