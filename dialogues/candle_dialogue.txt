Nothing matters.
Or does it?
I feel like nothing good will ever come my way. 
All I do is try not to fall apart. 
Hanging by a thread.
Everything is always changing. 
I have no stability in my life.
Things are so chaotic that I can barely keep it together.
I am so anxious…
…all the time…
I heard that sometimes rituals can help manage stress.
Is it true?
Tell me…
Do you have any calming activities in your daily routine?
Something you like to do to calm your nerves?

Thank you.
Yes, that sounds enjoyable indeed.
Sadly, in my life, it is just responsibilities all the way through.
Things I must do.
Things others want me to do.
But nothing I want to do.
To be completely honest with you…
I can’t remember the last time I felt happy.
Maybe if I did something I actually wanted to do, I would feel better.
But I don’t even know what that is anymore.
Maybe you could help me…?
Tell me, my friend. 
Are there any activities that bring you joy?
What activity helps rekindle your spirit?
